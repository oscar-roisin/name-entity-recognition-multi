"dalinm.hunpos" and "swedberg-gender.hunpo"s contain words 
and MSD-tags from the lmf-lexica swedberg.xml and dalinm.xml.
There is currently no script for creating them.

These files are used to create the hunpos morphtable file
"hunpos.dalinm-swedberg.saldo.suc-tags.morphtable"
with the module "hunpos_morphtable_hist.py".
